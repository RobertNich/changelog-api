# changelog-api

### About
A simple changelog api which can add new users with passwords, assign products to them, and each product can be updated with updatepoints.
Products, updates and updatepoints cannot be altered unless you are signed in with the corresponding user who has access to that particular product.
The users, products, updates, and updatepoints all have CRUD capabilities.
